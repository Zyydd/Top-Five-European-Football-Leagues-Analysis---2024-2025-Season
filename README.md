# Top-Five-European-Football-Leagues-Analysis---2024-2025-Season
This project provides a comprehensive dashboard analysis of the Top 5 European Football Leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1) using Power BI (Power Query) for data preparation and Tableau for interactive visualizations



ðŸ“Œ #Objective
  To deliver insightful visual analytics about players and teams in the top 5 leagues, covering:

  1- Player contributions (goals + assists)

  2- Defensive actions (tackles and interceptions)

  3- Goalkeeping stats (saves and clean sheets)

  4- Team goal comparisons

  5- League-wide trends (cards, goals, and player distribution)

  6- Player demographics and positional analysis




ðŸ§¼ #Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Power BI)
  All raw data was imported and cleaned using Power Query Editor in Excel:

âœ… Key Steps Taken:
  1-Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., PKA, PKsv, etc.)

  2-Renamed columns for clarity

  3-Split columns where needed (e.g., position into multiple roles)

  4-Filtered invalid or duplicate rows

  5-Replaced null or inconsistent values

  6-Standardized formats (e.g., date, names, teams)

  7-Created a clean, analysis-ready dataset for Tableau

## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Excel)

Raw data was cleaned using **Power Query Editor** in Excel.

### ✅ Key Steps:
- Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., PKA, PKsv)
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Split multi-value columns (e.g., position into roles)
- Filtered out invalid or duplicate rows
- Replaced null/inconsistent values
- Standardized formats (dates, team names, etc.)
- Final output: a clean, analysis-ready dataset for Tableau
